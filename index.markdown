![The United States of Poetry Smaller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70542175/217381420-57e82669-505d-4b05-9554-cb15be146cee.png)

<p><i> The United States of Poetry </i> produced by Bob Holman and Joshua Blum aired on PBS in 1996. It is a five part mini series featuring poetry by luminaries of American poetry, among them, Allen Ginsberg, Thylias Moss, Amiri Baraka, Leonard Cohen, Joseph Brodsky, Naomi Shibab Nye, and Robert Creeley, centered around thematic episodes like: "Dream," "We the People," "The Land and The People," and "A Day in the Life." Unlike recent PBS shows that engage the subject of poets and poetry like <i> Poetry in America </i> through documentary style interviews and archival footage, <i> The United States of Poetry </i> provides a fascinating case study of narratiziing lyric poetry and how a music-video-esque mode of rapid editing (Blum was an MTV producer) creates an entirely different feel and dynamism, presenting poetry performance in motion that is far from the coffee shop open-mic or the academic lecture hall. </p>
